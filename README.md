Project Overview: Calculator
Project Title: Interactive Calculator
Project Goal: To create a fully functional, interactive calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will demonstrate fundamental skills in front-end web development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and user interface design.
Technologies Used:
 * HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used to structure the calculator's user interface, including buttons, a display screen, and the overall layout.
 * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used to style the calculator, making it visually appealing and user-friendly. This includes styling the buttons, display, layout, and adding interactive effects like button presses.
 * JavaScript: Used to add the core functionality to the calculator. This will involve handling user input (button clicks), performing mathematical operations, and updating the display screen with the results.
Key Features:
 * Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
 * Number and Operator Buttons: Buttons for digits (0-9), a decimal point, and the four basic operators (+, -, *, /).
 * Clear and Equals Buttons: A "Clear" button to reset the calculator and an "Equals" button to compute the final result.
 * Display Screen: A screen to show the numbers being entered and the results of calculations.
 * Responsive Design: The calculator will be designed to work well on different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
 * Error Handling: The calculator should handle common errors gracefully, such as division by zero.
Project Structure:
The project will typically be structured with three main files:
 * index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator.
 * style.css: The CSS file to style the calculator's appearance.
 * script.js: The JavaScript file containing the logic for the calculator's functionality.
Learning Outcomes:
Completing this project will help you develop and solidify the following skills:
 * HTML: Structuring web pages using semantic tags.
 * CSS: Styling elements, creating layouts with Flexbox or Grid, and using pseudo-classes for interactive effects.
 * JavaScript:
   * DOM manipulation to dynamically change the content of the display.
   * Event handling to respond to user clicks.
   * Basic control flow (if/else statements, switch statements) and functions.
